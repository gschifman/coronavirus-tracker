I use this R code to regularly update the coronavirus tracker at Crain's New York Business. Data from the state's Open Data portal is downloaded and structured to identify daily rolling totals of coronavirus cases and tests in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. The code also the assesses the number of cases by borough and calculates additional figures that help readers put the state of the virus into context.

The tracker is in front of the Crain's paywall and available <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/tracking-coronavirus-new-york">at this link</a>. It's also regularly featured in our weekly print editions.

Note that the tracker also contains data separate from this code and the Open Data portal. Hospitalization counts are released in daily briefings by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Death and comorbidity figures are extracted from the Tableau workbook maintained by the state Department of Health; that can be found <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n">here</a>.
