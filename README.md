I use this R code to build and update the coronavirus tracker at <i>Crain's New York Business</i>. Figures from the state's <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data">Open Data portal</a> are downloaded and structured to identify total COVID-19 diagnoses and tests undergone each day in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. Hospitalization and death figures are downloaded from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-york">The COVID Tracking Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">U.S. Census Bureau</a> data is used to assess the per-capita incidence of the virus in each borough.

The dashboard, which is visualized with Infogram, is in front of the <i>Crain's</i> paywall and available <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/tracking-coronavirus-new-york">at this link</a>. It's also featured regularly in our print issues.
