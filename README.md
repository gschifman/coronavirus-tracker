I use this R code to build and update the coronavirus tracker at <i>Crain's New York Business</i>. Figures from the state's <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data">Open Data portal</a> are downloaded and structured to identify total Covid-19 diagnoses and tests undergone each day in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. The code also assesses the per-capita incidence of the virus in each borough and calculates statistics that put the pandemic into context.

The dashboard, which is visualized with Infogram, is in front of the <i>Crain's</i> paywall and available <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/tracking-coronavirus-new-york">at this link</a>. It's also featured regularly in our print issues.

Note that the tracker contains data separate from this code and the Open Data portal. Population totals are from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Hospitalization, death, and comorbidity figures are released in <a href="https://forward.ny.gov/daily-hospitalization-summary-region">two</a> <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n">dashboards</a> maintained by the state.
